# Expected CSV Output Pattern for AncestralClust Performance Logging
# This file documents the expected structure and content of CSV performance logs

# CSV Header (exact match required):
timestamp,milestone,duration_ms,memory_rss_kb,memory_virt_kb,thread_count,iteration,convergence_metric,cpu_percent,label,context

# Expected Milestone Sequence (logical order):
# 1. PROGRAM_START - Program initialization
# 2. OPTION_PARSING - Command line argument processing  
# 3. FASTA_LOAD_START - Begin FASTA file loading
# 4. FASTA_LOAD_END - Complete FASTA file loading
# 5. DISTANCE_MATRIX_START - Begin distance calculation
# 6. DISTANCE_CALCULATION - Individual distance computations
# 7. DISTANCE_MATRIX_END - Complete distance matrix
# 8. CLUSTERING_START - Begin clustering algorithm
# 9. CLUSTERING_ITERATION - Individual clustering iterations
# 10. CLUSTERING_END - Complete clustering
# 11. OUTPUT_WRITE - Write results to file
# 12. PROGRAM_END - Program completion

# Expected Data Ranges:
# - timestamp: Unix timestamp with nanosecond precision
# - duration_ms: 0.0 to 60000.0 (reasonable for test runs)
# - memory_rss_kb: 1000 to 100000 (1MB to 100MB for test data)
# - memory_virt_kb: >= memory_rss_kb
# - thread_count: 1 to 64 (reasonable thread counts)
# - iteration: 0 to max_iterations (algorithm dependent)
# - convergence_metric: 0.0 to 1.0 (typically)
# - cpu_percent: 0.0 to 1000.0 (multi-core can exceed 100%)

# Required Milestones (must be present):
# - PROGRAM_START
# - PROGRAM_END  
# - At least one FASTA_LOAD milestone
# - At least one distance calculation milestone
