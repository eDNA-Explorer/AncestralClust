# GitHub Actions CI/CD Workflow for AncestralClust
# 
# This workflow provides comprehensive continuous integration for the AncestralClust
# performance logging system, including:
# - Multi-platform testing (Ubuntu, macOS)
# - Complete test suite execution (unit, integration, stress)
# - Performance overhead validation (<5% threshold)
# - Test coverage analysis and reporting
# - Docker-based testing for consistency
# - Automated performance regression detection
# - Artifact collection and reporting

name: AncestralClust CI/CD Pipeline

# Trigger on push to main branches and all pull requests
